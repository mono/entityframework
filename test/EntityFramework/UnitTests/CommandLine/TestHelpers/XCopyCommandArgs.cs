    ///     Specifies a list of files containing strings.  Each string

    ///     /K           Copies attributes. Normal Xcopy will reset read-only attributes.
    ///     /N           Copies using the generated short names.
    ///     /O           Copies file ownership and ACL information.

    ///     existing destination file.
    ///     /Z           Copies networked files in restartable mode.
    ///     /B           Copies the Symbolic Link itself versus the target of the link.
